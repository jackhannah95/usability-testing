## Why do Usability Testing?

<p class="comment">
"From the moment you know enough to talk about a product—any product, whether it's hardware, software, a video game, a training guide, or a website—you know too much to be able to tell if the product would be usable for a person who doesn't know what you know."

## What is Usability Testing?

- Usability testing is designed to help diagnose and fix problems with prototypes of a software product (e.g. a shiny app) to determine whether the product is **usable**.

- It is undertaken during the development process, not after release.

- It is also a useful opportunity to assess the efficiency of, and user satisfaction with, a product.


## How does it work?




## The Purpose of Usability Testing

The main purpose of usability testing is not:

- To gain content ideas
- To provide a demonstration of the prototype
- To seek validation for your work
