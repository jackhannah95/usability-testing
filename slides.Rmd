<p class="comment">
"Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported."

* Bullet point
* Bullet point with *italic text*
* Bullet point with **bold text**
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
