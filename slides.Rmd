## Why do User Research & Usability Testing?

<p class="comment">
"Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported."

## User Research Process

```{r out.width = "90%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/user_research_process.png")
```


## Initial Engagement

- Method (e.g. Focus groups, interviews, survey)


- Design (Goals, objectives, questions)


- Participant recruitment (Who, why, and how?)


- Implementation (Where, when, what with?)
