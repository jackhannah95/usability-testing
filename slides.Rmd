## Why do Usability Testing?

<p class="comment">
"From the moment you know enough to talk about a product—any product, whether it's hardware, software, a video game, a training guide, or a website—you know too much to be able to tell if the product would be usable for a person who doesn't know what you know."

## The Purpose of Usability Testing

The main purpose of a usability test is not:

- To gain content ideas
- To provide a demonstration of the prototype
- To seek validation for your work

These may be indirect outcomes of a usability test, however its main purpose is to assess the ease of use of a prototype and, subsequently, to learn how to refine said prototype to make it more user friendly.
